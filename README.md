# Covid19_Detecting_using_Xray_Image_with_CNN

## Classification of COVID19 using Chext X-ray Images in Keras
In this study, a convolutional neural network model is proposed for classifying patients as infected with COVID or not using their chest x-ray images. And a image augmentation techique is used here for improving model's generalization. Our model produced an average classification accuracy of 94.6%.

X-ray images are obtained from https://github.com/education454/datasets

Please be aware of the fact that the dataset and the model in this project, can not be used in the real-life. We are only using this data for educational purposes.
